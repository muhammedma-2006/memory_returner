Project Description
 The AI-powered chat app where you talk to your past self.
 LoopChat is a unique self-reflection and journaling tool disguised as a chat application

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Our most brilliant, fleeting thoughts are homeless. An idea for a novel, a sudden moment of self-awareness, or a profound question about the universe pops into our head, only to vanish moments later, lost to the relentless forward march of time.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Traditional note-taking apps are merely cemeteries for these thoughtsâ€”static, lifeless records of a moment that has passed. You can read what you wrote, but you can't talk back. You can't challenge, question, or comfort the person who had that thought.
